# Array Manipulator

This exercise will provide you with a prebuilt-class, ArrayManipulator - an array extension which allows you to perform certain operations on a set of positive integers.
The goal of the exercise is to encourage you to write unit tests, taking into account the many edge cases possible.
Reusability of test methods is essential, so focus on using Data Providers in order to cover a variety of possible scenarios and input types.

## Rules

- You must only work on one test method at a time.
- You do **NOT** need to test the protected methods, getters or setters.
- In order to advance to the next test method, the one you are currently working on must have all tests passing and 100% code coverage.

## Steps

1. Spend 5 minutes reading through the ArrayManipulator class. Make sure you understand what is required. Ask questions if anything is unclear.
2. Run the unit tests - tests should be marked as incomplete.
3. Start working on each method in turn, taking into account the Rules in the section above, and the concept of Data Providers.
