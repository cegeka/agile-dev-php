# Integration

This exercise focuses on writing integration tests for a standard Table class, while also incorporating the refactoring mechanisms that you've learned.

## Steps

1. Tests need to be executed via the command ./integration-test.sh. Spend a few minutes reading on what the command does.
2. Start testing the methods. Remember you can use the @depends comment to "rely" on functionality verified in previous tests.

> Take care to check exceptions as well.
> If you finish with the tests, try some refactoring methods.
> Hint - what happens if the name of the table changes? Also, could the class be reused?
