# Harshad Numbers

In this exercise you will need to retrieve a set of numbers corresponding to the Harshad Algorithm.
The algorithm itself will not be described in this scenario (nor should you Google it) - the idea is to look at the tests and try to understand the requirements.
Working effectively with TDD requires that you are familiar with PHPUnit constructs and that you understand what needs to happen from the test scenarios.

This is an advanced exercise - it requires that you try to decode the algorithm for the numbers. Your pair should spend 10 minutes thinking about what the rule might be.

## Steps

1. Spend 10 minutes thinking about the possible rule in place. Once you think you have an idea or if you would like a hint, talk to the trainers. You should not spend more than 10 minutes on understanding the scope.
2. Implement each test in the algorithm, until all tests pass.
